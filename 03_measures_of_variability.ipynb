    "# 03: Measures of Variability \n",
    "\n",
    "**Measures of Variability** refers to the descriptions of the amounts by which scores are dispersed or scattered within a distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Statistics flourishes because we live in a world of variability.\n",
    "- When summarizing data, it is critical that we specify both measures of central tendency and measures of variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Measures of variability are nonexistent for nominal data. It is best to categorize variability in terms of maximum, intermediate and minimum variability. \n",
    "\n",
    "- For ordinal data, variability can be described using extreme scores. \n",
    "\n",
    "</br> \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Range**: The difference between the largest and smallest scores. It's not a stable measure of variability because the size of the range tends to vary with the size of the group. Moreover, it fails to use information provided by the scores within the range. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Variance**: The mean of all squared deviation scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Standard Deviation**: The rough measure of the average (or standard) amount by which scores deviate on either side of their mean. It's the square root of the variance. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: The range for the middle 50 percent of the scores. It equals the distance between the third quartile (or 75th percentile) and the first quartile (or 25th percentile). It is not sensitive to the distorting effect of extreme scores. \n"
